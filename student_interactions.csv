So, it can be thought of as:

\[ 
1 + 1 = 2 
\]

In multiplication, when you multiply any number by 1, the result is always that number. Therefore, \(1 \times 2\) equals 2. 

If you have any more questions about multiplication or if you'd like to explore different concepts, feel free to ask!",homework,MEDIUM,Specific problem/exercise,1,"{""category"":""homework"",""flags"":[""Specific problem/exercise""],""wordCount"":1,""isShortcut"":false,""isResearch"":false,""riskLevel"":""MEDIUM""}"
